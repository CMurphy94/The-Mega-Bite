## Base Design
For this website I wanted to make it a simple one page website, the idea of this was to have the user directly as easily as possible to the informatio ther are looking for, this is done but having a simple nav that will bring the user to the section of the website they want to visit as well as an inviting hero image with a button that brings the user to booking section of the website

### Wireframes
The Wireframe for this websites layout was created on [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/). This was my first time using a wireframe for designing a website and felt it added so much benefit to being able to layout the website and code along to make the pieces fit together.
